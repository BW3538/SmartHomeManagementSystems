# SmartHomeManagementSystems
Final year software engineering project, designed for a business that sells smart home systems, to better manage their clientele and products on offer. Made with WinForms and C#.

To use the project, first use the script.sql file to generate the system's database. SQL Server was used to create all tables, quesries, and stored procedures.
For the project to work with the database, the data access layer data access string must be changed to the computer being used.
